* TheLinuxPirate's Personal Emacs Configuration: 
  - *Introduction*
  This config uses a good amount of MELPA Packages so if you port this config remember to install those packages!:
  (The configuration contains a file that attemps to install the packages if they aren't already installed.)
  *[[https://github.com/DarthYoshi07/dotfiles][DOTFILES]]* <- The name DarthYoshi is an elden baller name I made when I was a bit younger so I'd perfer to gain credit as "TheLinuxPirate";

** Startup:
- (menu-bar-mode)
By default Emacs contains a menu-bar, I disable it;
- (scroll-bar-mode)
By default Emacs contains a scroll bar, I disable it;
- (tool-bar-mode)
By default Emacs contains a tool bar, I disable it;
- (tooltip-mode)
I do not enjoy having the tooltips, so I disable it;
- (display-battery-mode)
I have a laptop and I find it helpful to display the battery on the modeline; 
- (display-time-mode)
I like to have the current time displayed on the modeline;
- (global-display-line-numbers-mode)
This will display the line count at the left of your screen (GLOBAL);
- (set-fringe-mode)
This is set to 10 to give more room to the screen;
- (Emacs Bindings)
This will load & enable the Emacs bindings I set in "/keybinds/emacs-bindings.el";
- (Theme Path + Load-Theme)
Sets the theme load path the to dracula theme located in "/themes"; 
- (Load-File)
Loads the package repositories like MELPA and ORG;

* Appendix:
If you don't understand Emacs Lisp I will try my best to explain some of the code I use:
  - *Enabled/Disabled:*
  When something either contains a "-1" or a "1" this means it is either being enabled/disabled; -1 = Disabled ; 1 = Enabled
  - *Load-File*
  I perfer seperating my configurations into multiple files. This main file does not contain all of the code but the main part
  that is activated. This activation sequence loads the other files/code so it can be used. This is declared by "load-file".
  You will decalre: load-file "PATH_TO_FILE"
